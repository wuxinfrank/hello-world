# hello-world
The first project created here on this platform.
Hi there,I'm frank ,a newbie.I'm sort of interested in coding and curious about what hackers usually do ,so I want to figure it out,and probably write some program of my own.
I met a talking rabbit on my way home and there were three ears on her head.Her name was Bugs.
